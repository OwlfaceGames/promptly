# Promptly
A simple, minimalist and performant zsh prompt. I found it really annoying trying to find a good simple minimalist prompt that was performant so I had a go at making my own. I made this prompt for myslef and use it daily.

## Usage
### Clone repo 
```zsh
gh repo clone owlfacegames/promptly
```
### Source desired prompt config in your .zshrc file
```zsh
# load promptly
source $HOME/promptly/default.promptly
```
